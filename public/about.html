		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			Mohammad Gamal graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree
			in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Nile University in 2023. His
			graduation project, entitled "Intelligent GNC System Design for VTVL
			Rockets Using Deep Reinforcement Learning," incorporated knowledge from
			diverse fields like modern control theory, reinforcement learning,
			filtering techniques, mechanical design principles, physics, and game
			development.
		</p>

		<p>
			This project resulted in a control algorithm for vertical take-off and
			landing (VTVL) rockets and a corresponding simulation platform built
			within the Unity game engine, incorporating real-time physics to
			realistically simulate the designed rocket's behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, his research interests focus on the intersection of
			microarchitecture design and artificial intelligence. He has a broad
			interest in the low-level computing stack, encompassing areas from
			microarchitecture design up to compiler design. He is currently, working
			as a teaching assistant in the core department in the School of
			Engineering in Nile University, Egypt.
